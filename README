Demux MKV files:
 - `feed' reads a file, prints out the list of streams contained in the file.
 - `sink' connects to the `feed', obtains selected audio and video track,
   and writes elementary streams to the files video.out and audio.out.

TCP is used for communication between sink and feed. To preserve message
boundaries, each packet is prepended with four-byte (little-endian)
size of the packet. The protocol is as follows:

  sink                                                feed
       video_idx (4 bytes), audio_idx (4 bytes) ----->
       <------- "error message, if not found" <-------

       <------- type (1 byte), data (n bytes) <-------
       <------- type (1 byte), data (n bytes) <-------
       ...

The sink runs three threads: one receives data from the feed and dispatches
the received packets, the two others write the data to the files.
Connected socketpair is used to queue received data for writing.
